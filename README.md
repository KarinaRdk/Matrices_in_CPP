# S21Matrix Library
## Overview
The S21Matrix library is a C++ class designed to provide a comprehensive set of operations for matrix manipulation and mathematical calculations. This library is particularly useful for applications requiring matrix operations such as scientific computing, graphics, and machine learning.

## Features
<ol>
<li>Matrix Creation: Dynamically create matrices of specified dimensions.</li>
<li>Matrix Operations: Perform basic matrix operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.</li>
<li>Matrix Transposition: Transpose a matrix, swapping rows with columns.</li>
<li>Matrix Inversion: Calculate the inverse of a matrix, provided it is invertible.</li>
<li>Determinant Calculation: Compute the determinant of a matrix by Gaussian Elimination.</li>
<li>Matrix Complement Calculation: Calculate the matrix of minors and cofactors.</li>
<li>Matrix Equality Check: Check if two matrices are equal.</li>
<li>Matrix Copy: Create a copy of a matrix.</li>
</ol>

## Usage
To use the S21Matrix library, include the s21_matrix_oop.h header file in your C++ project. The library provides a set of functions for creating and manipulating matrices, as well as performing various matrix operations.
